**Decentralized Proof of Ownership using Solidity**

**Overview**

A blockchain-based system where users can register their work using smart contracts for immutable proof of ownership. It facilitates copyright trading through a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, ensuring secure and transparent transactions. This system prevents ownership disputes and unauthorized claims by keeping records decentralized and verifiable.

**Tech Stack**

Blockchain & Smart Contracts: Solidity, Thirdweb
Frontend: React.js, Next.js
Backend: Thirdweb SDK
Storage: IPFS (for decentralized file storage)

**Features**

✅ Immutable Proof of Ownership – Users can register their digital assets securely.
✅ Decentralized Storage – Uses IPFS and blockchain for secure, tamper-proof records.
✅ Smart Contract-Based Transfers – Enables copyright trading via Proof of Stake (PoS).
✅ Transparent Transactions – Ownership history is publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
✅ Secure Authentication – Integrates wallet-based login for secure access.

**Installation & Setup**

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (Latest LTS version)
Yarn (or npm)
Metamask Wallet (for testing on blockchain)
Thirdweb CLI

**Installation**

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

**Install dependencies:**

yarn install

Deploy smart contracts using Thirdweb:

npx thirdweb deploy

Run the development server:

yarn dev

**Usage**

1️⃣ Register Your Work – Upload details and deploy to blockchain.
2️⃣ Verify Ownership – Check asset ownership records on-chain.
3️⃣ Trade Copyrights – Transfer ownership securely via smart contracts.

**Future Enhancements**
